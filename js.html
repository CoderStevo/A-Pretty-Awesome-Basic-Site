        <ul>
            <li>JS stands for JavaScript.</li>
            <li>In a JavaScript document, the content tells the web browser how to respond to specific interactions from the end user.</li>
            <li>The only JavaScript code that is currently used on this site is on line 84 of the HTML source code for the Home Page. A screenshot of line 84 is provided below.</li>
            <li>JavaScript comments are left by the author to briefly explain what the code does by enclosing the comment in // and // tags. There are no JavaScript comments used here because the JavaScript is written into the HTML document and not linked externally like the CSS was, due to the fact that there was no extensive amount of JavaScript used. The small amount of JavaScript used to build this site was intentional to keep the concepts basic. In practice, Javascript code can easily take up numerous pages, which is why it is best practice to create a dedicated Javascript file and provide a link to it in the HTML as we did with the CSS file. Externally linking these files is a best practice because doing so will allow your HTML to be more compact and easier to read through, both for yourself and for anyone else that may be reading your code in the future.</li>
            <li>The image below is the JavaScript source code that was used to add functionality to the home page of this site. All it does is tell the web browser to take the user to a specified page if they click the button.  Technically, the hyperlinks used throughout this site (such as the links in the nav menu) also use click events to redirect the user to another page, but they are built into HTML in such a way that no JavaScript commands are needed, just a url. The button element is a little different because it takes an OnClick attribute, which is purely a JavaScript attribute. If you disable the use of JavaScript in your web browser, these pink buttons will not take you anywhere when you click them.</li>
